3. Your webhook server will automatically respond

## âœ… Verification Success Indicators

You'll know it worked when you see:

**In Notion:**
- âœ… Webhook status shows "Verified"
- âœ… Green checkmark next to your webhook

**In Your Server Logs:**
```
INFO:__main__:Handling URL verification challenge
INFO:__main__:Responding to challenge: challenge_12345...
```

**Test Health Check:**
```bash
curl https://your-webhook-url/health
# Should return: {"status":"healthy",...}
```

## ðŸ§ª Test Your Webhook

**Step 1: Make a change in Notion**
1. Go to your Performance Database
2. Edit any record (add a note, change a number)
3. Save the change

**Step 2: Check webhook logs**
You should see:
```
INFO:__main__:Processing webhook event: page.updated
INFO:__main__:Page updated: 12345...
```

**Step 3: Teams notification (if configured)**
Your Teams channel should receive notifications about the database changes.

## ðŸ”§ Troubleshooting

**Webhook shows "Failed":**
- Check your server is running and accessible
- Verify the URL is correct (include `/webhook/notion`)
- Ensure HTTPS is used (not HTTP)

**No events received:**
- Check you selected the right databases
- Verify events are enabled (page.updated, etc.)
- Test with a simple page edit

**400 Bad Request:**
- Check webhook secret matches
- Verify JSON payload structure
- Look at server error logs

## ðŸŽ‰ You're Done!

Your Notion webhook is now:
- âœ… Verified and active
- âœ… Monitoring your lab databases
- âœ… Ready to trigger automation workflows
- âœ… Sending real-time updates to your system

**Next steps:**
- Monitor webhook logs for incoming events
- Customize event processing in your server
- Add Teams notifications for critical alerts
- Set up dashboard updates for performance metrics
